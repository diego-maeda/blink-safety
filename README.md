## Blink-safety

Blink-safety is a project that helps increase awareness to domestic violence. 

The problem faced

We need to connect the blink1 dongle with the api services from police departments.

The first PD we could connect was St. Petersburg, FL through a public API.

Since we have to keep pooling the API for the server we need to keep a timeframe to run, for now we are using every 10 minutes.

Sending the code to github.
